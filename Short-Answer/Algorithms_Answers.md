#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)	O(log n)		-	The algorithm doesn't do the same number of operations regardless the input size, but it's also not Linear, which would mean the num of operations grows at the same rate as the size of the input grows. This algorithm does grow, but at a very slow pace. Which it would make me assume that it's Logarithmic Time.


b)	O(n log n)		-	The algorithm runs one operation per input elements, but it also does some aditional work for each one. It doesn't grows in a quadratic pattern, cause the aditional work in not that much. Which leads me to assume the algorithm is Log-linear time


c) 	O(n)			-	The algorithm grows as the input grows, in a recuring way. That's why I believe it's Linear time.
